This is an attempt to make a set of Koans for learning how to mock objects with Moq.
The Koans are written in C# and use MSTest.

-----

To use these Koans, start by opening the file "Moq1_Interfaces.cs".
Go through each Unit Test in order.
  1. Run the test to see that it is currently failing.
  2. Anywhere you see underscores (___), replace it with appropriate code.
  3. Then rerun the test to see if it passes.
As you finish all the unit tests in that file, move to the next .cs file in the project.
